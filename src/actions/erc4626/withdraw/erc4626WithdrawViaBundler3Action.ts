 * Action to withdraw from an ERC4626 vault via Bundler3.
 * The benefit of this over direct withdraw is slippage protection.
 * It is assumed the vault correctly implements the ERC-4626 specification: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626
 *
 * Note that while bundler3 also enables the use of permit2, this action uses explicit approval transactions.
 * This is to reduce complexity, and lends itself to a better UX for wallets with atomic batching capabilities (EIP-5792).
